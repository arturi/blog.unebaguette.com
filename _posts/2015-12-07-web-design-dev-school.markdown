We launched a web design and development course for beginners. 4 days — two weekends, 5 hours each. We study in a forest cabin (Working Station co-working space at Gorky Park), so during breaks we could play with squirrels.

In four days we figured out how the internet and browsers work, what it means to design for the web, how semantic markup, HTML and CSS are used to give meaning and style to the content. We’ve designed and built a page for an online-store that sells pumpkins (the course took place during Halloween) and a website about the movie “Hotel Grand Budapest”.

We tried design in the browser technique — instead of coding from a static Photoshop mockup, we worked on our designs that right in a code editor (Atom) and browser console. This let us see the final result and launch project way quicker.

We also made a JavaScript robot that can ask simple questions and talk to you. Learned how to load data from the server with AJAX/jQuery to make apps like weather, currency rates and Reykjavik airport timetable. The homework assignment was to make a single-page website about your five favourite places in Moscow. All in all, it was a total success, we are looking forward to the new upcoming courses.
